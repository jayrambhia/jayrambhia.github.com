## Hey!

## What do I like to do?

I love to code. I write various applications using Python and C++, especially Computer Vision based applications. I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2012 with SimpleCV. My project has been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2013 with SimpleCV. I believe in open source and I'm an active developer of [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/). You can fork my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/jayrambhia).
