My city drowned  
Dreams grew like a tree  
Thoughts bloomed  
Pin me up on your mind

I wish to hear your voice  
Wake me up  
Sing to me  
And we’ll build this city

Pin me up  
Let me stay  
Close your eyes  
Dream a new day

You smile but why do these roses bleed  
Am I sad or the city left me  
This lavender love letter  
Will it ever reach you, or just drown in the sky!
