Exams just got over and the happy days have just begun.

Lots of things to do and I very excited for the next 2 events coming up soon.

The first one being my college’s Inter Hostel Fest, Zephyr 2011. And the second one is much bigger for me, it’s the WordCamp.

In continuation to my [previous post][1]. Here is my todo list for the upcoming days —

1.  Start working on the presentation for my talk.
2.  Work on my current project.
3.  Give some time to the Visual Sitemap Generator
4.  Think of more things and *INNOVATE*

Need to put in more time and come up with great things.
