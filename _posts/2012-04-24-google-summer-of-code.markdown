Finally. The wait is over. After an hour, I found out via email that my proposal "[Automatic segregation of conveyor belt items using SimpleCV](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/jayrambhia/1)" as submitted to "[SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/)" has been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2012. I am so overwhelmed.

I thank everyone who have helped me and supported me.

P.S. I am GSoCer now.
