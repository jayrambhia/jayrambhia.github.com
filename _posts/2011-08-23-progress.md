After a long time of illogical brainstorming, I finally got to know why form validation was not working in Code Igniter (in one page.

You can see the question over [here][1].

What actually happened is while declaring the rules for the validation, instead of writing

    field

, I wrote

    name

Just this much and my code started working. Now I am over to the next portion which is developing a search.

Also, yesterday I started using [TiddlyWiki][2]. It is a really nice thing to stored your journals. Try using it once for sure.
