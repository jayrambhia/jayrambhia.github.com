<p class="lead">2012 has been an exciting year for me. I worked on a number of great projects and learned twice more than what I did in the previous year.</p>

## The year in Open Source

The year has been quite eventful in terms of the projects I open-sourced.

I was able to make a [pull request](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/pull/2105) to CodeIgniter finally. It took me a year to finally be able to contribute to open source projects.

Other than this, I open-source the code for [eDorado](https://github.com/aniketpant/edorado). It's a small web application I wrote for an event which is a part of my college's technical festival.

There were a number of other developments that I made in my old projects. You can take a look at the [repositories on Github](https://github.com/aniketpant).

## Other Developments

I [moved on](/notes/moving-on) to Jekyll from WordPress which has been a great experience in itself. Because of this tiny change, I have a stronger understanding of OOCSS as I used [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com). Thank you [Harry](http://csswizardry) for inuit.css.

**The Mutiny:** I am now working with [Web Mutiny](http://webmutiny.in) as a technical lead. A personal thanks to [King Sidharth](http://kingsidharth.com) for getting me on the team.

**[Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in):** I must say that this has been the most fulfilling part of the year. I will able to take a short break after 2nd February 2013.

<span class="note">P.S</span>
I will be concentrating more towards poetry, working out, and more open source contribution to some of the great projects I have been working with.
