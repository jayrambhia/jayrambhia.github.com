It’s been hardly a month since college has started and I have already become so busy.

#### What Happened?

1.  Post frequency has decreased to 1 per week.
2.  Activity on Stack Overflow has reduced.

#### What I Have Been Doing?

1.  Working on some front end designs.
2.  Working on the last project I was on.
3.  Studying, exams approaching.

#### Music I Have Been Listening To

*   The Devil Wears Prada
*   August Burns Red
*   Texas In July
*   Thursday
*   Rise Against

Will be writing on the new page I made in my next post.

Also, a new tutorial on something interesting soon.
