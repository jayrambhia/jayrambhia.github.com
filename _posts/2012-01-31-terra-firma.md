This room is not what it seems like  
Go see the painting on the wall  
The future is painted in black and white  
And if I’m not right, then you better be wrong.

Shed your inhibitions  
Break these walls  
Look outside  
Feel the rain

You don’t need to search for the light  
Come close to me my love  
I’ll show you the life in you  
Stay near, don’t ever leave

Flowers give in to spring  
Even the leaves fall in autumn  
But the love we have will last  
Till the stars shine in the skies

I hope you won’t ever go  
The smile would last forever  
And your beauty won’t fade away  
Just like this serenade will never end.
