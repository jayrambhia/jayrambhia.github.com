I don’t remember exactly when and how all this started off, but I am sure it was 6 years back.

I was in class 9th that time, when my dad gave me a book on C++ by **Robert Lafore**. That time I hardly understood anything and just went through a couple of things. Learnt the usual **Hello World!** program and it was quite fun. Soon, I was making small programs for fun. It was a great experience.

By the time I got to class 11th, it became one of my subjects and it was one of the things I really really loved A LOT. My first project was a small game I made using C++. It was really simple, I might put the code up if I find it :P

The amazing thing I did that time was that in my game I was supposed to move a red ball like object using arrow keys and my dad gave me an idea for that. He asked me, “How would I move something on a black background?”. To make this happen, what we did was that we created a red solid circle and to move it, we would make a black solid circle over it and then make a new red solid circle at the new place.

I never worked with **graphics.h** after that and I have NO IDEA about the developments that have been made but this was my first project and I am still very proud of what I made then. By the end of my next year I had completed quite some topics which were beyond the scope of my school syllabus. The extra thing I did was virtual base classes and this was the most amazing thing that I had used in my 12th class project.

This time my dad gave the idea to make an **Inventory Management System** for the school, but it was too big to build, so we limited it to just a **Furniture Management System**. I made it to some extent and then I got stuck at one point where my dad helped me with it. I still haven’t left the habit of leaving out things in the middle but it has reduced to a great extent.

BTW, I am listening to **Animals As Leaders** now and one thing I can say for sure is that this is THE BEST progressive music I have ever heard.

Moving on to college, I had no idea on what I should have been doing in my first year. But when I went back home for vacations, my dad got me back on the lines of coding. I was introduced to **Joomla!** and it was amazing. I started off with a small project which was a major failure even without fully working on it. I won’t call it a failure as it led to something big. After coming back from vacations, I got to know about a guy who was hiring some people for Web Dev work. And I got interested. Soon, I was working with him and I am glad that I worked with him. Learnt so much and because of what happened nearly 10 months back is this. (Yes, I am new to the web).

Thank you everyone dad, who inspired me to work.

On a brief note —

> Many people have told me to try new things but I am not able to leave HTML, CSS and Codeigniter. People tried to teach me Cake and  Yii, but I tell you, they were nothing in front of Codeigniter. I tried out working in Android but the websites called out to me.
