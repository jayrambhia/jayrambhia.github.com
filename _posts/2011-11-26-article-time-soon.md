## The Start

Two days ago, I told [King Sidharth][1] to help me with an idea for an article for [A List Apart][2]

Having no idea on what to write on, he suggested to write on **HTML5 Semantics and Good Coding Practices**. Yesterday, I began writing it. It will take sometime as I am busy *studying for my exams* which will start in a week and playing *Assassins Creed 3* (not liking it much, finishing it because I stated off with it)

## The Goal of the Year

One of my goals for this year was to get an article of mine, published in **A List Apart**. An attempt for that is the one I am working on!

## The article

So, the article is coming out fine. What I’ll do is, I’ll post the headings under which I am writing.

1.  Introduction
2.  The Changes in the Sections
3.  Groupings
4.  How to use the additions
5.  Good Code
6.  My View
7.  Conclusion

Hoping that it comes out fine!

## Other Thoughts

Apart from this, there hasn’t been anything interesting for quite sometime now. Even HN is getting boring for me now, no good things coming up! Weird!

And the worst part is that I got the copy of Inheritance in the beginning of the month, and I haven’t read it after the 5th chapter. This is so sad :(
