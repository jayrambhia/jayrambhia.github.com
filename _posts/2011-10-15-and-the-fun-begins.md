After nearly one full day of traveling, I have reached my hotel room.

Let me first describe the journey a bit.

I started on 13th Oct evening from Goa, took a bus to Mumbai (that takes like 12 hours). Reached Mumbai at 7:00 AM, boarded a train at 12:30 PM for Jabalpur and reached here at 4:30 AM. Quite hectic, but now I am very much excited for today’s events.

It is going to be super fun. In the next hour or so, we will be leaving for the venue.
