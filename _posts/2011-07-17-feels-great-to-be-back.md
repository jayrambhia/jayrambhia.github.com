Just setup my workstation. My HDD is on and speakers back with me. Sum 41 playing and I feel like getting back to work.

#### Things Completed

*   Got over with my internship
*   Made quite some changes to the website
*   Started two small projects which should be done by end of July
*   Setup my newsletter with the help of Mail Chimp
*   Signed up for new newslettters

#### Things Left

*   Watch Movies
*   Start working on new projects
*   Hmmm… Drum a little

I’ll keep everyone posted and get to work in sometime. Need to take some time off work.
