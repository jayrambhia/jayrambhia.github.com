It’s been a couple more than a week that I was introduced to ASP .NET and my current project has not only taken it’s shape but is nearly completed.

You would be wondering, “What is he working on?”. Well, what I am working on is just another Online Test System.

**What it has?**

*   User Management – 3 Categories: Admin, Teacher, Student
*   Questions Type Management
*   Subject (Add/Edit/Delete)
*   Class (Add/Edit/Delete)
*   Questions Management
*   Paper Generation by some queries
*   Test Generation by populating a paper

This is what it is.

I am through with Paper Generation. What I am left with is the Test Generation and once that is done, I’ll release it.

> Working in ASP .NET helped me learn ASP as well as C#. Plus, the whole logic of how and why to design a database in a way is clear to me.

Will make a whole documentation and put it up as soon as it is done.

**Estimated Time of Release:** 9th July 2011
