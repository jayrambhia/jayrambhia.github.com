---

Lately I have been using numpy way too much and there's no point in doing things non-pythonic way so I always look for some cool tricks using which I can increase the speed and get the correct output. I require numpy basically for Image Processing and Computer Vision. I always forget these tips and have to look up again on stackoverflow, so I am compiling a list of all such tricks that I have used.

I'll keep updating the gist and this post.
