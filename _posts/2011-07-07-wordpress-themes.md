For quite sometime I was busy reading articles for design inspirations and finally I have found what I have been looking for.

First thing is that I need to clean up the code for my last two themes.

1.  Creative Foliage
2.  Fallen Leaves

I recently updated these two on my [git][1] too.

To Do:

1.  Leave Creative Foliage
2.  Make Fallen Leaves “My Creation”
3.  Work on getting my themes better and more “theme-like”

**Also the recent source of inspiration is [this][2]**

And now I need to get back to writing some new **original stuff**.
