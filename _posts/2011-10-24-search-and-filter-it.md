Exams are over (again), it’s quite boring and irritating when you have exams every now and then (that is like once every month).

Now they are over, I can resume work \*happy\*

Thing for this week -

1.  Complete front-end work on a project
2.  Challenge : Create a Search with Filtering options

I have no idea about what to do with the 2nd task.

So, I am going to post a question on stackoverflow to get some help :)

Here is the [link][1]. (please do post some answers if you can help me out)

Also, here is some work that I did in the last 2 days (made these for fun)
