It’s been around 4 days now and I wasn’t able to move any further, so I decided to just chuck the validation for the time being and move ahead with the other modules of my current project.

Actually, the problem was that, I had 2 different user types and a registration form. I am using a single controller and single view to use them, but when I use the form to submit the details, they were not getting validated. I posted on the CI forums to but it wasn’t of any help. I didn’t even get any reply from Stack Overflow so far. :|

As of now, I have skipped the validation and I am just posting the values directly.

The links to the posts are here

If you read, this post and can help me in anyway, I would be glad :)
