_image missing_

This is another random work of mine.

Maybe cuz I got too high on illustrator a while back, but now I returned to my site design roots.

This was inspired by Carla Ceia’s CV. You can check his site [here][1].

And as for the work I am doing right now, I am making an Online Test Module through ASP .NET

Coming up pretty well.

I’ll be posting it once it’s done.

Also, I guess I never read about multiple text shadows in CSS, but tried them by mistake today. It works.

You can also go for multiple box shadows as they work in the case of ‘inset’.
