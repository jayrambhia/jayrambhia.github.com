This year has been going really great so far. I haven’t been able to write anything so far but will be regular now.

There are quite a lot of things that have kept me busy and happy at the same time. The two events I am managing for my college’s festival [Quark 2012][1] are going well.  
I will soon share the problems I have created for one of the events. The other event is the treasure hunt and it’s called [E-Dorado][2].

Apart from this I haven’t been able to put much time into [dabbling][3] and this is the only [good thing][4] I have been able to make so far.

A little list from my side to read:

1.  [Tools of the Trade][5] : A little post by Sacha Grief on the various design and UI kits you can go for
2.  [Impress.js][6] : The most brilliant presentation tool I have ever seen and used.
3.  [High Quality Free Fonts for 2012][7] : A list of great free fonts you can go for, curated by Smashing Magazine
4.  [30 Free Programming eBooks][8] : If you want to read some programming ebooks, check out this great list curated by citizen428

That would be all as of now and I need to learn CSS 3D Transforms now, they are quite amazing!
