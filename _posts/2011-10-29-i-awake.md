A dark cloud over the moon  
Cold air surrounds me  
I wish I could make the sun bleed  
And still feel you beside me

Summer is long gone  
My pen is still ever since  
These words will be alive soon

We will walk in the rain  
And get drenched in love

I wonder if my thoughts could reach you like letters  
Brown paper and a heart  
But no tear in your eye

If you call for me  
I want to be there  
I wish I could  
I feel I will

I want to make the stars paint your name in the sky  
Write all my words  
I, awake
