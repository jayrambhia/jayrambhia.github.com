## Good things which happened recently

Reached back home last nite and I have been missing my blog for quite some time now.

A couple of days back King gave me a great idea to write on. He told me to pick up any Web App and write on how it can be made better (semantic) by using HTML5.

And yesterday, I myself got the idea of writing a template in Codeigniter for a basic website, that means the login, registration and sample pages, all ready to use. Gives me a good vibe! Will get on to it today only.

## And the good ideas I saw recently…

WordPress 3.3 update, the bar is looking good, but I feel that the side admin bar can be reduced a little, looks cluttered for me.

Github changed again, and I am not liking the top buttons, seems to icon-ish.

Today only I discovered [Dabblet][1]. It can be easily called the father of [jsfiddle][2] in terms of  HTML and CSS as we have live changes and easy access in Dabblet with the advantage of saving it as a gist on Github.

And the last thing would definitely be changes on delicious. It’s looking way better and clean.
