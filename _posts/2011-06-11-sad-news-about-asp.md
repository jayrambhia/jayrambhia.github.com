I just learnt that I cannot host my ASP site on my current hosting as is it is Linux based.

So, what I will do is, when I done with making the manual. I will post it here :)

And maybe sometime later, when I make it better, I might go for a windows based server and host it. Till then I will keep working on making it better.

**Note to make: An issue with ASP based websites, that they cannot be hosted on a Linux Based Server.**

Windows is a little weirds, but not possible to **NOT** use it.
