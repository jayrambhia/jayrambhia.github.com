It’s been 11 days since I took on this project and it just needs the finishing touch now.

It’s easy to understand that such systems can be made more flexible and can be expanded more and more.

Well, I have tried my best to make it as flexible as I could think of and what was within my knowledge.

The things I am left with are:

*   Result display after a test.
*   Editing of various records
*   And some BLING :P

Will be up in 2 days as promised (unless some issues come up) :D
