Don’t just breathe  
Feel life  
The life in my veins

Well I’m not dead  
Blood flows through my veins  
I’m no puppet of yours  
My heart beats fast  
Faster than you can speak up,  
For yourself!

Untie your hands  
Let your thoughts wonder  
Into a dreamland  
Don’t let him drive you to his Doom!

Sadness is not all around me  
It just find some pieces in my life  
Ruins, not everything is like that  
Find what you want  
Take it and keep it safe  
Don’t let misery fall upon it!
