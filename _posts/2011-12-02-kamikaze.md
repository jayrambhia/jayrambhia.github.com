Look upto the sky  
Watch the rain fall  
The dark days are over  
Misery won’t befall you

The light fades away  
Show yourself  
Don’t be afraid  
Watch the sun set

Come down to me  
These words don’t mean anything to you  
You just want to kill everything you see  
Your heart just says  
Take everything, leave nothing

Don’t you see these ashes  
Haven’t you seen the blood on the streets  
What about the girl waiting for you?  
Remember what she looks like!

Think when she waved goodbye  
Hoping to see you again  
Drop this gun  
Head back to home

Leave this town  
Back to where you came from  
This is just another world  
Another dream, come away with me!
