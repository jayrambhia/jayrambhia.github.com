title: Wireless Firmware missing in Linux
---

It's been a year since I started using Linux. The first problem that I faced was my **Wireless Firmware** was missing. I never bothered to do anything about it until now. My brother installed a router at my place and to access the Internet, I had to install the missing firmware. I had tried doing this couple of times before, but couldn't find a solution.


I found this really helpful post on [Linux Mint Forums.](http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=89410)

####Installing b43 Linux Wireless Driver:

I read somewhere that to install b43 in Ubuntu, all you need to do is 

    $ sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer

And it will take care of the rest. But that didn't work for me.
I found this on the above mentioned forum page.

Download [b43 firmware](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10573557/b43_firmware/b43.zip)

Extract it.

Move the folder to **/lib/firmware**

    mv b43 /lib/firmware

After moving the folder, do

    $ sudo modprobe -v b43

This worked like a charm. Posting this using WiFi.

P.S. I'm back home. Feels great.
