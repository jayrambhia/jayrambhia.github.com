## The Talk

<p class="lead" markdown="1">My talk was focused in general on the basics of **Theme Development in WordPress**. I went on to cover aspects like _Child Themes_ and why they are **so good**.</p>

## Quotes

	<p>We are the architects of the Web, and this is our playground.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>People say Web Design is not coding, I call that bullshit.<br/>We design the web by coding.</p>
</blockquote>
