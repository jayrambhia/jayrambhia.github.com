## The Talk

<p class="lead">I had only 15 minutes to speak as the event was a short one, though quite interesting.</p>

So, I showed the crowd some awesome stuff like &mdash;

 * [Space CaSS](http://lab.simurai.com/space-cacss) made by [Simurai](http://simuari.com)
 * Some of my own demos
 * And a <span class="highlight">live demo</span> using JsFiddle

## Quotes
